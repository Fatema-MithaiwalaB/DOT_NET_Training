**ðŸš€ .NET Training - Task Outputs**

**ðŸ“Œ Introduction**
Welcome to the .NET Training Repository! This repository contains my daily coding exercises and outputs, focusing on mastering essential C# concepts.
Each dayâ€™s progress is recorded with expected outputs from the programs, showcasing practical implementations of the concepts.

**ðŸ“† Daily Task Outputs**

**ðŸ“Œ Basics**

ðŸ“… Day 3 - You are working in the HR department of a company, and your task is to manage employee records. Each employee has the following properties: Name, Age, Department, and Salary. 
You need to perform the following tasks using lambda expressions:
Filter the employees who are older than 30 years.
Sort the employees by their Salary in descending order.
Transform the list of employees into a list of employee names who are working in the "Sales" department.
(Use the lambda expression)

ðŸ“… Day 4 -  Create a program that demonstrates Asynchronous Programming in C#. The program should utilize the async and await keywords, implement Task-based asynchronous programming,
and use Parallel processing with Task.Run to execute multiple operations concurrently
